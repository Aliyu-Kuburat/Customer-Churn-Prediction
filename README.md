# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Build a system that predicts if a customer will stop using a service (churn). You’ll clean and analyze data, create useful features, train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and deploy your model with Streamlit so users can test churn predictions.

Telco Customer Churn Analysis Report

1.	Introduction
This report presents a full analysis of customer churn for a telecommunications provider. The goal is to identify why customers leave and to build a predictive model that flags at-risk customers early. Insights from this report enable more effective retention strategies, improved customer experience, and stronger revenue stability.

2.	Data Overview
The dataset contains demographic information, contract details, billing data, and service usage. The target variable is Churn, indicating whether a customer has discontinued service. Before modeling, the data was cleaned, encoded, and structured to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Project Overview:
The main objective of this project was to predict customer churn in a telecom company. This involved analyzing various customer attributes to identify factors contributing to churn and building predictive models to proactively identify at-risk customers.
Dataset Used:
The dataset utilized for this project was "/content/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv", containing 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features) with 'Churn' as the target variable.
Analysis Steps:
1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
o	The TotalCharges column, initially an object type, was converted to a numeric (float) type. During this process, null values introduced by coercion were implicitly handled as NaN. (However, it was observed that no nulls were initially present based on df.isna().sum() and df.info() output, but pd.to_numeric can introduce them).
o	Checked for and confirmed no duplicate rows were present.
o	No outliers were explicitly checked or handled.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:
o	Correlation Analysis: Explored the relationships between numerical features (SeniorCitizen, tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges). Key findings included a strong positive correlation between tenure and TotalCharges (0.83), and a moderate positive correlation between MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges (0.65).
o	Churn Distribution: Examined the overall distribution of churn, revealing an imbalanced dataset with more 'No' churn instances than 'Yes' churn.
o	Impact Analysis: Analyzed the impact of various features on churn:
	MonthlyCharges: Customers who churned had higher average monthly charges. Further binned MonthlyCharges into custom categories (18-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100, 101+) to observe churn rates, noting higher churn in the 61-80 and 81-100 categories.
	gender: No significant difference in churn rates between genders when considering MonthlyCharges.
	tenure: Customers who churned had a significantly lower average tenure (approx. 18 months) compared to those who did not churn (approx. 37.5 months).
	Contract: Longer contract terms were associated with lower average monthly charges and lower churn rates.
	Categorical Features: Conducted crosstab analysis for SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, and PaymentMethod. Key observations included higher churn among customers without online security, tech support, device protection, senior citizens, those with month-to-month contracts, and those using electronic checks.
o	Feature Engineering: Created a new categorical feature MonthlyCharges_Category_Custom by binning the MonthlyCharges column to analyze churn patterns within specific charge ranges.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Three different machine learning models were trained and evaluated for churn prediction:
1.	Random Forest Classifier:
o	Configuration: n_estimators=200, max_depth=10, class_weight='balanced', random_state=42.
o	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score for both classes), and Confusion Matrix.
o	Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 0.769, with a recall for churn (class 1) of 0.71 and precision of 0.55.
o	Feature Importance: Identified Contract, tenure, MonthlyCharges, OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and InternetService as key drivers of churn.
2.	Logistic Regression:
o	Configuration: max_iter=1000, class_weight='balanced', random_state=42.
o	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.
o	Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 0.736, with a recall for churn (class 1) of 0.80 and precision of 0.50.
o	Feature Importance (Coefficients): Highlighted Contract (negative coefficient, indicating retention for longer terms) and PaperlessBilling (positive coefficient, indicating churn driver) as most impactful.
3.	XGBoost Classifier:
o	Configuration: n_estimators=200, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1, scale_pos_weight for class imbalance, random_state=42, eval_metric='logloss'.
o	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.
o	Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 0.748, with a recall for churn (class 1) of 0.76 and precision of 0.52.
o	Feature Importance: Similar to Random Forest, Contract, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, and TechSupport were important.

Model Comparison:
A comparison table and bar chart were created to visualize the performance of all three models across various metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for both 'No Churn' and 'Churn', Macro F1, and Weighted F1).
•	Overall: Random Forest generally showed slightly better overall performance, especially in accuracy and weighted F1-score.
•	Churn Recall: Logistic Regression had the highest recall for churn (0.80), followed closely by XGBoost (0.76) and Random Forest (0.71).
•	Business Insight: While Random Forest or XGBoost might be preferred for production prediction due to slightly better overall accuracy and balanced F1-scores, Logistic Regression's coefficients offer clearer interpretability for explaining churn drivers to stakeholders.
Deployment Preparation:
The best-performing model (Random Forest) was selected for deployment. The model and encoders (for categorical features and target variable) were saved using joblib for future use in a Streamlit application (app.py), and a requirements.txt file was generated.

Model Recommendations:
Based on the comparative analysis, Random Forest and XGBoost models demonstrate superior predictive performance for identifying customer churn. Therefore, Random Forest or XGBoost are recommended for deployment in production environments where accurate churn prediction is paramount. Their higher accuracy and robust handling of complex relationships make them ideal for predictive tasks.
For explaining churn drivers to stakeholders and gaining interpretable insights, Logistic Regression is the preferred model. Its coefficients directly indicate the direction and magnitude of a feature's impact on churn, making it excellent for communicating 'why' a customer might churn.
Key Churn Drivers:
The analysis consistently highlighted several significant factors driving customer churn across all models:
•	Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts are a very strong indicator of churn.
•	Tenure: Customers with shorter tenures are significantly more likely to churn.
•	Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn, especially in the 61-100+ range.
•	Online Security: Lack of online security services is a major churn driver.
•	Tech Support: Absence of tech support services correlates with higher churn.
•	Internet Service Type: Fiber optic internet service users show a higher propensity to churn compared to DSL users.
•	Paperless Billing: Customers opted for paperless billing tend to churn more.
•	Senior Citizen: Senior citizens have a higher churn rate.
•	Device Protection: Lack of device protection also contributes to churn.
Actionable Retention Strategies:
To mitigate customer churn, the telecom company should implement targeted strategies focusing on the identified drivers:
1.	Target Month-to-Month Contract Customers: Offer incentives (e.g., discounts, bundled services, loyalty bonuses) to encourage customers on month-to-month contracts to switch to longer-term contracts (one-year or two-year), thereby increasing their commitment.
2.	Early Tenure Engagement: Implement proactive engagement programs for new customers, particularly within their first year, to ensure satisfaction and address any early issues that might lead to churn.
3.	Bundle Security & Support Services: Actively promote and bundle online security and tech support services, especially for customers currently without them. Highlight the value and benefits of these services to improve retention.
4.	Address Fiber Optic Customer Satisfaction: Investigate the reasons for higher churn among fiber optic users. This could involve improving service reliability, offering better customer support for technical issues specific to fiber optic, or re-evaluating pricing strategies for this segment.
5.	Review Paperless Billing Experience: Understand why paperless billing is associated with higher churn. It might indicate a segment that is less engaged or more price-sensitive. Consider offering personalized communications or benefits to these customers.
6.	Senior Citizen Specific Programs: Develop tailored plans, support services, or educational resources for senior citizens, addressing their specific needs and concerns to improve their loyalty.
7.	Optimize Pricing for High Monthly Charges: For customers with high monthly charges, especially those in the 61−100+ range, consider offering personalized plans, loyalty discounts, or value-added services to prevent them from seeking alternatives.
8.	Offer Device Protection Incentives: Promote device protection plans more actively, perhaps by bundling them with other services or offering initial trial periods.


4.	Exploratory Insights
